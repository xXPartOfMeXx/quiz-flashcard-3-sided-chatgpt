NOTE: 
- Sometimes the Quiz just have 3 answers and sometimes 4 (idk why 🤣) and I ain't fixing that. Consider it as a feature lol
- I will be likely to add a feature to import your flashcard set in the [Creator](https://xxpartofmexx.github.io/3faceflashcard-creator/) site directly from the button in it (Near future)
- Future plan:
  + Button to GitHub and Creator
  + Make a start button after importing. Currently it's just import and you're in
  + Let you choose which face is the question, answer, and explanation (currently Face 1/2/3 by default)
  + A matching mode? (not multiplayer)
  + Title with the file name (Fancy~)
  + Multiple language! (**Vietnamese - current language**, English, Russian)
- Currently it has several drawbacks and stuffs, if u find any, contact me at [Panana Astley](https://www.facebook.com/panana.astley) on Facebook
